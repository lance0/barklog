## Milestone 4: Enhanced Features ✅

- [x] Search highlighting (matched text highlighted in yellow)
- [x] Match navigation (n/N for next/prev match)
- [x] Horizontal scrolling (h/l, H/L, 0 for line start)

- [x] Log level detection and coloring (c to toggle)
- [x] Line wrapping toggle (w to toggle)
- [x] Mouse wheel scrolling
- [x] Timestamp parsing and relative time display (t to toggle)
- [x] JSON log pretty-printing (J to toggle)
- [x] Bookmarks (m to toggle, [/] to navigate)

## Milestone 5: Multiple Sources ✅

- [x] Kubernetes pod log source (kubectl logs -f)
- [x] SSH remote file tailing (ssh + tail -F)

## Milestone 6: Themes ✅

- [x] Themeable color system
- [x] Built-in themes: default, kawaii, cyber, dracula, monochrome
- [x] Theme selection via config file and environment variable

## Release Prep ✅

- [x] Unit tests for core modules (filter, app, theme, config) - 51 tests
- [x] Module-level documentation (doc comments)
- [x] Centralized constants (buffer sizes, debounce, scroll lines)
- [x] Improved error messages with actionable hints
- [x] Config error reporting (warns on invalid TOML)
- [x] CLI help with examples and environment variables
- [x] README troubleshooting section
- [x] CI workflow fix (main → master branch)

## Milestone 7: Multi-Source Support ✅

- [x] Multiple sources via CLI (`--docker nginx --docker redis`)
- [x] Source manager for merging multiple log streams
- [x] Source identification on each log line
- [x] Merged timeline view (all sources interleaved chronologically)
- [x] Source visibility toggles (Space to toggle in Sources panel)
- [x] Solo view mode (v to show only selected source)
- [x] Show all sources (a key)
- [x] Source-colored prefixes in log view
- [x] Per-theme source color palettes
- [x] Runtime container discovery (D for Docker, K for K8s)
